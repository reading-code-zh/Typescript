## ✅ Viability Checklist

<!--
   Suggestions that don't meet all these criteria are very, very unlikely to be accepted.
   We always recommend reviewing the TypeScript design goals before investing time writing
   a proposal for ideas outside the scope of the project.
-->
My suggestion meets these guidelines:

* [ ] This wouldn't be a breaking change in existing TypeScript/JavaScript code
* [ ] This wouldn't change the runtime behavior of existing JavaScript code
* [ ] This could be implemented without emitting different JS based on the types of the expressions
* [ ] This isn't a runtime feature (e.g. library functionality, non-ECMAScript syntax with JavaScript output, new syntax sugar for JS, etc.)
* [ ] This feature would agree with the rest of [TypeScript's Design Goals](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals).
