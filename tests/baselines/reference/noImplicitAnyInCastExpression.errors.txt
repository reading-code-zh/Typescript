tests/cases/compiler/noImplicitAnyInCastExpression.ts(15,2): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ c: null; }' to type 'IFoo' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type '{ c: null; }' is missing the following properties from type 'IFoo': a, b
